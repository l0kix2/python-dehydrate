Contribution
============
Any contribution is welcome. Use fork/pull request mechanism on github.

If you add some code, you should add some tests, so coverage of master branch
should always be 100%. Refer to Testing_ section for more instructions.

Let me speak from my heart :). I will be very glad, if you correct my clumsy
english phrases in docs and docstings or even advise more appropriate names
for variables in code.
